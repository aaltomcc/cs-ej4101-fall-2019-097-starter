A few paragraphs of text are required here, so I decided to write about how requirements are managed in software engineering; a topic I've often encountered in both academia and the private sector.

Software engineers are often told to approach the problem of requirements engineering with the mindset that the customer (or user) knows best, but in reality different firms (and users) can often have wildly different processes and practices even when they are solving the same problem. Most commonly these behaviors are the result of normal competitive specialization, but they can also be *invalid*, and have no real economic value. Like cargo cults which attempted to summon airdropped supplies by waving waving their hands in futile rituals on long-abandoned airstrips after World War II had ended, unique environmental conditions can lead both firms and even whole industries into adopting deeply rooted processes that can have almost zero chance of achieving economically valuable goals. For example, political and regulatory requirements could greatly affect how an industry operates even after the regulations are removed.

Such cargo cult requirements are just one example of how the user can be wrong. I argue that the mindset of listening to users first can lead to poor results, unless tempered with critical examination of the discovered requirements. To create the best software products and solutions, we should strive to understand the customer's domain holistically; a practice that begins with listening to the customer, and ends with critically but genuinely understanding them.
