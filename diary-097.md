# this course

I decided to take this course because I was missing one course credit from my degreeâ€”I had 299 out of 300 credits needed to graduate. Out of all the courses I could take, this course had probably the highest combined score in the two dimensional scale of effort and value. 

Though simply passing the course and obtaining that one final credit is my primary goal, the time spent on this course is all the more beneficial if I can also learn something from it. Obviously one can not expect much from a one credit course, especially when it's about a subject you have previous experience from. However, one should not undervalue the value of revisiting what you've learned from new perspectives. My learning goal for this course is to observe how DevOps is viewed in an academic context, and to fill in possible gaps in my previous knowledge.

Reflecting on how my studies and practical work have integrated, one factor I've previously undervalued is the learning  of common terminology. In retrospect, I've certainly learned more from my professional work than from my studies, but studies have enabled much of the professional learning; or at least sped it up. And one of the ways in which it has helped, has been the learning of foundational concepts and terms; by having some background information about most subjects, even if not particularly deep knowledge.
