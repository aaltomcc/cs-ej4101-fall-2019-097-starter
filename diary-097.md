# this course

I decided to take this course because I was missing one course credit from my degreeâ€”I had 299 out of 300 credits needed to graduate. Out of all the courses I could take, this course seemed to provide both the required one credit, and a topic that was interesting and relevant to my profession.

Though simply passing the course and obtaining that one final credit is my primary goal, the time spent on this course is all the more beneficial if I can also learn something from it. Obviously one can not expect much from a one credit course, especially when it's about a subject you have previous experience from. However, one should not undervalue the value of revisiting what you've learned from new perspectives. My learning goal for this course is to observe how DevOps is viewed in an academic context, and to fill in possible gaps in my previous knowledge.

Reflecting on how my studies and practical work have integrated, one factor I've previously undervalued is the learning  of common terminology. In retrospect, I've certainly learned more from my professional work than from my studies, but studies have enabled much of that professional learning; or at least sped it up. And one of the ways in which it has helped, has been the learning of foundational concepts and terms; by having some background information about most subjects, even if not particularly deep knowledge.

# learning

I already had practical experience with the topic and tools of the course, so I focused on developing a better understanding of the topic in general, and in identifying any knowledge I might be missing. Overall this course provided a brief introduction to various DevOps topics and the philosophies behind them. In addition to sharpening my understanding of the terminology, I learned a bit about the history of DevOps, and how it's viewed in academia. In general, this course was quite practically oriented; less academic, and more applied. I think for most students this is better, though I would have liked to develop a better understanding of how the topic is handled in academia, and what research has been done. Though this is just personal curiosity. 

In general, doing research about "soft" problems that involve people and organizations in software engineering (as opposed to "hard" problems such as algorithms or theoretical computer science) seems quite difficult. Experimental research about soft problems is mostly limited to single case studies due to the difficulty of statistically significant test setups (randomized controlled trials in a domain such as this seem nigh impossible), and conceptual research is not particularly popular, even though I'd personally like to see such research encouraged more. Of course, many DevOps tools and practices exist in the first place thanks to earlier research, and there are also "hard" problems to which researchers have contributed.

DevOps skills are in high demand in Finland, and in Europe. There's high demand for software engineering in general, but DevOps seems to be the topic du jour. Regardless of why it has become so popular (it is usually a good investment!), I hope that it instills a lasting *philosophy of progress* into the many companies that have chosen to pursue it.
